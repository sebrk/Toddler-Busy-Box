# Toddler-Busy-Box


Working Code for my Sons Busy Box I built. Work in progress.

Code is a mess, was on a tight schedule for xmas 2019. Will update stl files for the control panel plastic inserts/battery compartment.

TODO: Upload

STL's for component fixtures and insets

SVG for Control Panel with Laser Cut Ready formatting (3mm black acrylic)
